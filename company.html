                At Handpoint, we are tech-enablers, and our role is to offer a simple interface so developers can add integrated card payment solutions into their mobile, tablet, or PC point-of-sale.
            </p>
                We developed beautifully simple APIs for our sleek and modern card readers while taking an extra step in security by being the first to implement a PCI-P2PE solution for mobile point of sale.
            </p>
            </p>
                By building simple yet powerful products, we allow developers to focus on delivering a seamless experience to their users, without having to spend months on integrations and payment certifications.

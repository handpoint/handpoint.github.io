**About the Mobile POS Project**

As one of the major leisure boating destinations in the UK Lymington Harbour needed an ability to make ‘on the water’ sales using a mobile payment system. The company needed a highly portable electronic mobile point-of-sale system that addressed these issues and selected Harbour POS from Zero-One Data Ltd with Handpoint’s fully integrated card payment acceptance solution.

**About Lymington Harbour**

Lymington Harbour is an independent port situated in a beautiful Georgian market town on the southern edge of the New Forest at the western end of the Solent. The company prides itself on providing a friendly welcome to all harbour guests that enjoy their marine services, local stakeholders and other harbour users.

**The Challenge**

One of the main priorities was that the new system needed to be highly portable and robust as Lymington harbour patrols need to be able to make sales while alongside customer’s boats. The system also had to be robust enough to be used in all weathers and have the capability to accept card payments.

“Previously this was achieved with a hand written ticketing system. The downside was that the previous system was labour intensive and provided little management information. Also, we could only accept cash and cheques as payment options for on the water sales.”
-Ryan Willegers, Harbour Master & Chief Executive at Lymington Harbour.

The key goal for Zero One Data, the Independent Software Vendor, was to provide the Harbour Master’s office with a system to better manage the data regarding boats utilising moorings, electric, water and other services provided at the Harbour and to include integrated card payments acceptance as part of that overall solution.

**About Zero One**

Zero One Data provide specialist web- based systems and mobile applications for business use. Most of the software is provided as ‘software as a service’ - meaning the company provides a complete package including a fully hosted system without any need for the customer to install any software.

**The Solution**

The solution consists of a small mobile chip and PIN card reader and a customer relationship management system that sits on an Android tablet. The payment solution from Handpoint is integrated with a customised software application made by Zero One Data and the two devices communicate over Bluetooth. The integrated payment solution is capable of accepting both Chip & PIN and magstripe payments using debit and credit cards. The software application sitting on the Android tablet allows for analysis of customer databases and card transactions information as well as conducting the sales transactions themselves.
 
**Mobile POS Case Study**

“The integration with the software application was relatively simple. The Handpoint payment API for Android was accessible from handpoint.com. Our development team downloaded the software development kit (SDK) and started the integration process between the payment solution and our software application. To finalise the process and test the solution we ordered a demo-kit on the website, which contains the card reader and a test card from Handpoint, and integrated the payment solution with our application. The integration process went pretty smooth. There were some technical challenges to overcome, most notably the need for the mobile payment system to communicate by WiFi with the main server to ensure that all mobile payment units were updated as sales were made. To overcome this, WiFi aerials were installed in strategic locations around the harbour. In the case of card sales, there is a need for the card authorisation process to be conducted in real time. If the WiFi signal is weak or there is an issue with the broadband connection, the mobile payment system has the option of communicating via 3G.”
-Steve Goacher, Zero One data

**Results**

 * Ability to accept, track and reconcile payments
* The system provides the information necessary to ensure an auditable collection of revenue and with the collection of email addresses, helps Lymington Harbour to keep in touch with customers with offers and promotions
* Accuracy of payment processing – less susceptible to human error
* Solution is well suited to the needs of Harbour Masters – extremely mobile with a long battery life

“The new system has been well received by customers. The main benefits to them are that repeat transactions can be processed much more quickly as we already hold their details on the system, and they can now pay by card where previously this was not possible. The system benefits our Harbour Patrol staff because they can now see at a glance which boats have paid and where they are moored. Because the system is fully automated, it also saves them time when undertaking their end of shift reconciliations. From a corporate perspective, the main benefit of the new system is that it allows us to collect much more management information about our customer’s use of the harbour which in turn allows us to make informed strategic decisions.”
-Ryan Willegers, Harbour Master at Lymington Harbour

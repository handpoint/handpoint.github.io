LONDON (October 22, 2014) — Optimal Payments (LSE AIM: OPAY), a leading global online payments provider, has partnered with Handpoint to provide a Mobile Point of Sale (MPOS) solution to merchants in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The new MPOS solution allows merchants to securely accept face-to-face Chip and PIN card payments from customers anywhere. The solution can be used with the NETBANX® mobile application or is available as a white label version using the Handpoint Software Development Kit (SDK)*, allowing it to be easily integrated into existing applications. All sensitive data is encrypted within the card reader and sent securely and instantly to the PCI-DSS compliant payment gateway, meaning no card details are stored on the card reader or mobile device. Leveraging Handpoint technology, Optimal Payments’ MPOS solution can be used to accept and process transactions on Android and iOS smartphones as well as tablets, using an EMV card reader linked by Bluetooth. It gives consumers a convenient and secure way to pay for a variety of goods and services.

“The release of our MPOS solution with Handpoint in the UK and Ireland is the next evolution in the Optimal Payments’ suite of services,” **said Danny Chazonoff, chief operating officer, Optimal Payments**. “It will help to increase sales from cashless consumers whilst providing companies with a quick, simple and secure payment option.”

“Handpoint is excited to partner with Optimal Payments to offer a proven payment option to clients across the UK and Ireland,” said **David Gudjonsson, CEO and co-founder, Handpoint**. “The MPOS solution was the first to be PCI Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE) certified worldwide meaning that there is no need to panic if the card reader or mobile device is lost or stolen because all data is stored securely on the payment gateway. Merchants will also have a choice of card readers, designed to fit their payment processing needs.”

TSYS, a leading global payments provider, has certified the mobile EMV solution brought to the US by Handpoint, a global leader in next generation point of sale. TSYS is the first processor in the US to certify Handpoint’s mobile EMV solution, which is designed to enable partners with the ability to offer semi-integrated EMV on iOS, Android, and Windows devices.

Handpoint’s semi-integrated offering provides pre-certified EMV payments to Integrated Software Vendors (ISVs) and Value-Added Resellers (VARs) of NextGenPOS (mPOS/tabletPOS). This easy-to-implement solution enables integration to a range of card readers and all payment types with P2PE security in just a few lines of code.  This industry-leading simplicity enables developers to focus on core product innovation, while adding a secure method for accepting payments, including magnetic stripe, EMV and NFC contactless payments.

“We’re pleased that TSYS is the first US processor to certify Handpoint’s award-winning semi-integrated solution,” **said David Gudjonsson, CEO and co-founder of Handpoint**. “This new offering allows ISVs and VARs to address high merchant demand for both EMV and mobile devices with minimized complexity – at integration, at installation, and through the entire merchant relationship.”

“We are excited for the EMV certification of Handpoint to TSYS platforms,” **said John Badovinac, director of developer partnerships for TSYS’ Merchant Services segment**. “The Handpoint software application is highly valuable in helping our VAR and ISV business partners — as well as our merchants — satisfy EMV market requirements in the United States.”

Using a semi-integrated architecture, exchanges between the PIN pad and point-of-sale (POS) are limited to non-sensitive data. With an integration to Handpoint, ISVs entirely avoid lengthy EMV certifications, and their PCI compliance is dramatically simplified. Fully-certified through all major card brands, Handpoint enables P2PE secure payments on a range of card readers designed for the future of retail. The highly-scalable Handpoint solution also features remote terminal management, enabling the fastest device activation and zero-merchant-effort updates.

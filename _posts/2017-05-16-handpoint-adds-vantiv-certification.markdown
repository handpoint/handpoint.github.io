With the payments industry in a period of rapid evolution, it’s essential that ISOs and ISVs move swiftly to
integrated payments to reduce merchant churn and grow their merchant partner base. By certifying with Vantiv,
Handpoint gives ISOs, ISVs, and merchants a technological edge and speed to market with its robust Platform as
a Service for integrated payments.

Today, many payments companies are looking for differentiation that enables them to stand out from the competition,
and speed to market is critical. Yet, channel partners and merchants are left to link together a maze of hardware
and software, certifications, and integrations. Handpoint has eliminated this complexity, giving ISOs a scalable
turn-key platform to migrate to integrated payments, no matter their current level of sophistication. ISOs and channel
partners utilize the Handpoint Platform to go to market quickly with integrated POS, and can efficiently scale with
Handpoint’s cloud-based tools to board merchants in seconds, easily deploy terminals, and even remotely configure,
activate, update, support, and enhance card readers.

Vantiv ISOs can leverage Handpoint to get to market with integrated solutions aligned to their strategy and unique merchant
portfolios, whether they need an off-the-shelf integrated MPOS app or want to resell one of the many integrated tablet POS
solutions using Handpoint. ISOs on the platform also can leverage Handpoint’s powerful and accessible SDKs to integrate
end-to-end payments into their own POS software, adding Handpoint’s semi-integrated mobile EMV and NFC card readers with
P2PE and specialized features such as Tip Adjustment.

Handpoint Developer Partners have integrated to Handpoint’s PaaS solution, in some cases, the very same day. Building
tools that empower developers to have more options and functionality with less work is a core mission of Handpoint, and our
Vantiv certification is yet another step forward in this endeavor. Handpoint’s CEO David Gudjonsson said:

"Enabling developers to build powerful and secure payments functionality for their organizations is a key focus of Handpoint’s
PaaS solution and our mission to support seamless commerce and payments. With our Vantiv certification, we’ve married the
ease and functionality of the Handpoint platform with one of the leading acquirers in the integrated payments space. This
powerful combination will be a great opportunity for ISVs, merchants, and ISOs who are looking for a robust and flexible
payments platform solution.”

With Handpoint’s Vantiv certification, ISVs and ISOs can move seamlessly to integrated payments with both industry-leading
technology and processing capabilities.

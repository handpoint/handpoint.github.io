Johannesburg, SA, July, SureSwipe – Payment Services provider launches the first mPOS application to achieve PCI-P2PE certification in South-Africa. SureSwipe Move is a mobile card machine that works with a smart device to accept all major card payments. The mobile point of sale solution powered by Handpoint is tailored to address the needs of small and medium sized merchants.

South Africa might be leapfrogging traditional payment terminals and going directly to mobile POS. The country, seen as an emerging market, has been adopting the EMV standard since 2005. South Africa lacks modern Internet and the usage of PC´s is very low with roughly 11% of the population having access to a PC while mobile penetration however, is skyrocketing at 128% and with over 11 million smartphone users. South Africa’s use of smartphones is also expected to double over the next four years.

*“The potential for secure mobile POS solutions are extensive in the South African market. We see it as an opportunity not only for micro-merchants but also for small and medium businesses.”* **Paul Kent, Managing Director of SureSwipe**

*”Mobile POS is having a disruptive, yet positive effect on all market segments globally and SureSwipe Move is a new payment acceptance option on the South African market that will surely have a positive impact on both merchants and consumers.”* **Davíð Guðjónsson, CEO& Co-founder Handpoint**

There are 1.2 million businesses in South Africa and only 416 thousand POS terminals in operation nationally. Highlighting that around 60% of all retail businesses do not accept card payments, while 75% of South Africans have credit or debit cards so the need for an increase in card acceptance points is definitely on the rise.

Traditional POS solutions are expensive and the application process is lengthy and full of red tape. Merchants need to prove their worth in order to gain access to accepting card payments, with strict conditions such as showing a turnover of over 100 thousand Rands per month, of which more than 20% must be card based. That might be easy for an established business but a barrier for smaller start-ups.

Smartphone card payments using SureSwipe Move will provide easy and affordable access to business owners and boost profitability. Not to mention the convenience for all consumers. No one likes to carry cash and this eliminates the need for it says Kent.

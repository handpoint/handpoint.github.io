The good news just won’t stop at Handpoint these days! While we are still celebrating our recent Payments Awards, we just got the news that we are amongst the finalists at the FinTech Innovation Awards 2015 and this time in two categories!

The first one being the “Anti-fraud/Security Initiative” category for our PCI-P2PE certified application and the second one the “Mobile Point-of-Sale” category for our end-to-end mobile payment solution.

Here you can find more information about the awards and the other finalists, and you can even take part by voting [here](http://www.paymenteye.com/fintech-innovation-awards-vote/).
We are really excited about this and can’t wait for the award ceremony which will be at The Brewery in London on the 18th of March 2015.

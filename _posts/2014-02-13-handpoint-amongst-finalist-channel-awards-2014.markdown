**About the MPE Awards**

The Merchant Payment Ecosystem Awards (MPE Awards) are awards that recognise the outstanding role of card acquirers, processors, PSP’s and respective solution providers and honor companies and individuals who help moving the payment industry forward. The MPE awards broadened their scope in 2012 to also cover new players on the payment acceptance scene – mobile and online payments companies, mPOS providers, payment methods, young and promising startups, industry disruptors and innovators as well as outstanding individuals with special achievements in the payment acceptance area.

**The Guiding Hand by Sofie Muller**

A highly skilled artist Sofie Muller created a unique statuette just for the purpose of the MPE Awards. For the third year in a row, Sofie Muller, an internationally recognized Belgian sculptor, shapes and casts a series of ten „Guiding Hand“ statuettes, one for each of the award categories. Each such piece, beside the symbolic value for the winning company or individual, represents also an individual piece of art of true collector value.

description: Handpoint introduces a queue busting mobile POS solution | You can now pay on the fly in Nike Air Stores

Handpoint launched a new Mobile POS Solution in a retail store called Air this May. The Video Case Study shows a game changing new mPOS device for EMV payments – One device with a built in cradle for iPhone 5 and a hybrid reader for chip and magstripe cards along with a scanner.

Some might have seen a similar solution for magstripe payments used in Apple Stores in the US but the Handpoint mPOS solution is for Chip and PIN payments and has unmatched PCI P2PE security.

The new solution is a revolution for retail – now merchants can truly mobilize their checkouts with their current POS system and enhance the customer experience.

**The project is a cooperation of three companies:**

* Handpoint brings the device and the payment service.
* LS Retail provides the ePOS application
* and Advania brings in the backend Navision system

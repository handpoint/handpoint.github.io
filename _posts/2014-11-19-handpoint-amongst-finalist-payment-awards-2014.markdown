“P2PE represents a significant breakthrough for the enterprise mobile payments market,” says **David Gudjonsson, CEO and co-founder of Handpoint**. “We have utilised P2PE to overcome the barriers that have prevented enterprise retailers in Europe from embracing mobile payments; namely concerns over security, compliance and integration. Handpoint’s PCI-accredited MPOS application reduces the burden on enterprise retailers to gain individual PCI accreditation, in terms of cost and time, and represents the most secure way to introduce Mobile Point-Of-Sale.”

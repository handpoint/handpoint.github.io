      <p>
        In no event shall Handpoint, its employees and directors or its suppliers
        be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss
        of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use
        or inability to use the Products, even if Handpoint or a Handpoint
        authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
        possibility of such damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties
        by law, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, these limitations may not apply to you. In such cases where
        Handpoint liability can’t be excluded by law, the total liability of
        Handpoint, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise,
        shall in no circumstances exceed the total amount Handpoint has received
        for your use of the service, whether you are a direct customer of
        Handpoint or not, at the time when the loss occurred

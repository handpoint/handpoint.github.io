      <p>To accept payments, you need 2 things: 1) an account set up with your payments provider, and 2) a Handpoint PAX SmartPOS terminal.</p><p class="specialtxt">Not sure if you have one? Get in touch with your provider.</p> <p class="specialtxt">If you are using another POS software app on a PAX terminal, please contact your software provider for detailed activation instructions.</p>
  - header: Launching
    txt: >
      <p> To power on your Handpoint PAX SmartPOS terminal, hold down the power button on the right side of the terminal for 3-5 seconds. Your Hanpdoint app may start automatically.  If not, please select the Handpoint icon to launch it.</p> <p class="specialtxt">If you do not see the Handpoint icon, you can open the PAXSTORE icon and search for "Handpoint".</p>
  - header: Connecting to WiFi
    txt: >
      <p> You need to connect your terminal to the internet.  The Handpoint app may walk you through steps to help you connect.</p> <p> You also can use the touch screen to connect.  Simply bring the settings bar down from the top of the terminal screen. You must pull it all the way down until the settings appear in full with icon names. Select Wi-Fi (below the Wi-Fi icon) and toggle the switch to enable Wi-Fi. Once the list of available Wi-Fi networks appear, select your desired network. You may need to enter your WiFi password. When your card reader has successfully connected to the network, it will confirm by displaying “connected” below the network name.</p> <p class="specialtxt">This should be just like adding a new phone or laptop to your WiFi.</p>
  - header: SIM Connection
    txt: >
      <p>If you are connecting to the internet via SIM, first insert your SIM - Push the battery cover slide latch (at the back of the card reader) to the right to open, remove the battery case (lifting from the bottom) and take out the battery (also lifting from the bottom). Insert your SIM, replace the battery and cover. Slide the lock closed.</p>
      <p>From the landing screen of the PAX, open the Settings application and take the following steps:</p>
      <p>a) enter the password pax9876@@ and click “OK”</p>
      <p>b) Select “More” —> Select “Cellular Networks” —>Select “Access Point Names”</p>
      <p>c) Select “+” at top right and fill in the APN settings</p>
      <p>d) Select the drop-down, dotted icon (three dots icon) —> Select “Menu” —> Select “Save”</p>
  - header: Handpoint SmartPOS App Activation
    txt: >
      <p>The first time you activate your Handpoint SmartPOS app, your terminal may need to dowload a few things before it can start taking payments.  If so, this will happen automatically and will only take a couple of minutes.</p> 
      <p>The Handpoint SmartPOS app then will ask you to choose some basic settings, including your language, currency, and refund password. In a few steps, you’re all set!</p>
      <p class="specialtxt">If you want to change any of these settings later, simply click into the settings of the Handpoint SmartPOS app.</p>
  - header: Start taking payments
    txt: >
      <p>Now you can start accepting payments with your Handpoint PAX SmartPOS solution. </p> 
      <p>Enter an amount, and click PAY.</p>

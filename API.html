        At Handpoint it is all about APIs. Our platform is built on APIs from the gateway to the Terminal Management System and to the SDKs 
        for 3rd party developers. Using a semi-integrated architecture all complex payment handling is abstracted and developers simply have to
        use one of our simple APIs to integrate their POS software to our platform, payment enabling them in three continents with multiple
        processors.
      </p>
      <p>   
        Our APIs support a broad range of developer tools and devices including iOS, Android, Windows, Web based POS and cross-platform tools
        like Cordova.
    </p>
    <p>   
      Have a look at our development tools and <a onclick="window.open('https://www.handpoint.com/docs/device/Basics/')" class="ui item" title="Documentation">API Documentation</a>

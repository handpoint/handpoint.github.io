			At Handpoint it is all about APIs. Our platform is built on APIs from the gateway to the Terminal Management System and to the SDKs 
       			for 3rd party developers. Using a semi-integrated architecture all complex payment handling is abstracted and developers simply have to
        		use one of our simple APIs to integrate their POS software to our platform, payment enabling them in three continents with multiple
        		processors.

        At Handpoint it is all about APIs. Our platform is built on APIs from the gateway to the Terminal Management System and to the SDKs 
        for 3rd party developers. Using a semi-integrated architecture all complex payment handling is abstracted and developers simply have to
        use one of our simple APIs to integrate their POS software to our platform, payment enabling them in three continents with multiple
        processors.
      </p>
      <p>   
        Our APIs support a broad range of developer tools and devices including iOS, Android, Windows, Web based POS and cross-platform tools
        like Cordova.
    </p>
    <p>   
      Have a look at our development tools and <a onclick="window.open('https://www.handpoint.com/docs/device/Basics/')" class="ui item" title="Documentation">API Documentation</a>
   </p>    
    <p> 
      Remember to be in touch if you have any questions.

      <p>  
        One single integration to our APIs gives you access to any of Handpoint's card readers.

        If a new card reader becomes available, you can start using it right away without having to go through the development process 
        again.

        You'll be notified if a new call is available in the SDKs and can decide whether or not to support the new functionality depending on what makes sense for your business.

        Want to work with all of our processing partners? No problem. When you integrate to our API, you have access to them all. No extra development required.

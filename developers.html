                 As a point of sale provider, you can stop worrying about payments, EMV certifications, and long discussions about which processors you want to partner with in order to reach the largest audience of merchants. Handpoint brings a complete solution directly to you. An integration to our APIs gives you an instant access to multiple processors around the world as well as pre-certified EMV terminals, so you can be ready to accept payments as quickly as possible.

              Our card readers support several types of transactions; from basic sales, to refunds and reversals, to transactions which require tipping capabilities. Our team is always working to add new functionalities as well, such as authorization-only which will be available in early 2017. Developers have extensive control over the transaction status and result. It's easy to add information to a receipt or display the status of a transaction directly on the point of sale so merchants can follow the checkout process. We provide everything you need to make a payment experience that's personalized for your merchants.

                There is power in simplicity and we demonstrate this concept by offering an API that can be integrated in only half an hour. Thirty minutes is all you need from start to finish in order to implement a complete EMV, NFC, or MSR transaction. Carrying a full integration doesn't take more than a couple of weeks, and we make sure that our interface remains simple and limited to only the most essential functionalities necessary for your business. Speed to market is one of the most important factors for success and we keep this in mind when designing our products.

              Once you have carried out the integration, we want to make sure that the distribution and activation of your point of sale with the Handpoint card readers meets expectations. To ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible, we'll work with you to find the best approach to bring the end product to market. Whether we send the card readers separately or offer the full POS solution in a bundled package, we can adapt to suit your needs.

                When starting integration with our APIs, you have two solutions: you can either order a development card reader and test cards by contacting Handpoint directly, or you can start by using our card reader simulator which is available for free online. Sample apps and getting started guides are available on our developers website and we recommend that you download our simple mPOS app from the Google Play Store or Apple Store in order to get familiar with our solution and the functionalities we provide.

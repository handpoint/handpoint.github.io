              Our card readers support several types of transactions, basic sales but also refunds and reversals. Handpoint also offers tipping and our team is always working towards adding new functionalities. As an example, authorization only will be an available feature in early 2017. Developers have an extended control over the transaction status and result. For instance, it is simple to add information to a receipt or display the status of a transaction directly on the point of sale for merchants to be able to follow the checkout process. We give you all you need to make your very own payment experience, you just need to focus on what features YOU want to include, and how best to serve your merchants.

                There is power in simplicity and we demonstrate it by offering an API against which you can integrate, literally, in thirty minutes. Half an hour is all you need to be able to start coding and finish the implementation of a complete EMV, NFC or MSR transaction. Carrying a full integration do not take more than a couple of weeks and we make sure to always keep our interface simple and limited to essential functionalities for your business. Speed to market is one of the most important factor for success and we make sure to always keep this in mind when designing our products.

                When starting integrating against our API's you have two solutions, you can either order a development card reader and test cards by contacting Handpoint directly or you can start by using our card reader simulator available online for FREE. Sample apps and getting started guides are available on our developers website and we recommend that you download our simple mPOS app from the Google Play Store or Apple Store in order to get familiar with our solution and the functionalities we provide.

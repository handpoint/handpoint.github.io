        Handpoint has <b>always</b> had security as its number one priority, <b>everywhere</b>. Starting with the design for the new cloud platform,
        everything was designed with P2PE architecture in mind, providing a full encryption of all data from the terminal to the PCI-DSS compliant 
        Handpoint gateway and then onwards to the acquiring bank / processor.

        As a proof of that, Handpoint was the world's first mPOS provider to receive the coveted PCI-P2PE validation for its payment application
        (software terminal).
      </p>
      <p>
        As Handpoint has designed and developed all parts of it software platform including the software terminal, 
        encryption service and gateway / switch, Handpoint is in full control over all aspects of the platform and is not reliant on
        3rd parties when it comes to securing the data always, everywhere. This also takes into account management of encryption keys which
        are only stored in special hardware-security-modules (HSMs) with tamper resistance to avoid 3rd parties accessing any encryption keys.
      </p>

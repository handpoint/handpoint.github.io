             All of the payment logic is handled by the card reader software so that developers can focus on streamlining the checkout experience for their merchants and customers. Starting a sale transaction is as simple as calling an API function. The best part is that you don't have to be a pro in the payments industry to integrate with our SDKs.

                As developers, we prefer to avoid lengthy and convoluted documentation so we can get down to what we really want to do: start coding! With that in mind, we built our documentation around examples, sample apps, and Getting Started guides that are open source. Just copy/paste the code and start trying out the different functionalities.

                All sensitive cardholder data information is encrypted on the card reader and transmitted via secure connections all the way to the acquirer. The fact that your app will never receive any unmasked or unencrypted cardholder data information keeps <strong>your software company fully out of the PCI-DSS scope</strong> and does not obligate your company to comply with any card security standard.

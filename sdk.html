                Handpoint Software Development Kit (SDK) brings integrated payments at your fingertips. Our solution is all about making MSR, EMV and NFC card payment acceptance a fast and easy process,  that is the reason why we have developed a set of SDK's offering a simple communication interface with the Handpoint card readers. All of the payment logic is handled by the card reader software so that developers can focus on their merchants and customers checkout experience. Starting a sale transaction has become as simple as calling an API function. The best part about it is that integrating with our SDK's does not necessitate any thorough knowledge of the payment industry.

                As developers we fear a long and unhelpful documentation and we usually only want one thing, start coding! With that in mind, we built our documentation around examples, sample apps and getting started guides that are open source, you just have to copy/paste the code and start trying out the different functionalities. If any question arise, you can contact our support team which is always available to help, it goes without saying that customer satisfcation is our first priority.

                All sensitive cardholder data information is encrypted on the card reader and transmitted via secure connections all the way to the acquirer. Handpoint was the first mobile solution in the world to be certified for point to point encryption (P2PE) and we proud ourselves to always comply with the latest security standards. Achieving such a degree of security also allows merchants to have a drastically reduced scope for PCI-DSS evaluation. All merchants accepting card payments have to comply with this security standard every year, by using the Handpoint card readers this task is decreased to a simple self-assessment questionnaire.<br> 

               The fact that your app will never receive any unmasked or unencrypted cardholder data information keeps your software company fully out of the PCI-DSS scope and do not obligate your company to comply with any security standard, Handpoint takes care of this burden for you.

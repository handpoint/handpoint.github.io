Summary
-------
(Summary should be consise and to the point with enough information that anyone at the company could potentially take over. This is meta-information about the product/project. Purpose is to get everyone involved aligned on the goals and boundaries of the work and to facilitate "organisational memory" so that proper reasoning can be used when making decisions in later stages of the product development. Typically the following information should be included.)

__Contacts__

(Anyone who has a say should be included here. For example the following if applicable)

* Product Manager:  
* Business Analyst:
* Lead developers: Antoine Trota
* External Stakeholders:
* Internal Stakeholders:

__Problem Definition__
Current website is confusing with a mixed message. It is not clear to audience what product we offer, what kind of service we provide or even what we actually do. Redesign of UI and content is needed. It can also be cumbersome to update content. The current website does not generate leads (or at least not directly)

__Business Goals__

(So we've identified the user goals so to say in the problem definition. It is important to describe the business goals as well. F.ex. impact on revenue, conversion rates, benefits, etc. Describe current situation and expected change)

__Success Metrics__

(Include here clear measurable and attainable goals that all stakeholders and product team agree with. Include current benchmarks so that progress can be measured accurately. The success metrics tell you at the later stages if the product was a success!)

__Competitive Analysis__

(Provide analysis of competitor features or product if relevant. What is the competition doing? how is our better?)

__Project Scope__

(Describe here what is included in the project/product and more importantly what is out of scope. A clear definition of scope facilitates a clear understanding of what systems and product areas this will affect)

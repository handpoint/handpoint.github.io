    <div class="row paragraph">
      <p>
        Handpoint has been a pioneer in defining integrated payments for over a decade, 
        from advancing the checkout experience with mobile technology 
        to launching open payment integrations for all emerging POS platforms -- on 3 continents.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide solutions for merchants, acquirers, payfacs, ISOs and ISVs who are delivering 
        this edge for payments: where customer experience and management matter, 
        where payments are embedded seamlessly, and where mobile technology fuels growth. 
        Handpoint's software terminal, international gateway, and terminal management system
        enable the future of acquiring, from mPOS and integrated POS to a future without terminals.
      </p>

            <p>Handpoint’s roots date back to 1999 when the founders set up a company to leverage first generation
              mobile technology to help merchants gain visibility and simplify operations.

            <p>
              Having built the business twice and sold to start over again, the founders have built on years of

              point-of-sale.

    <div class="row paragraph">
      <p>
      Handpoint led the way in mobile EMV – introducing mobile POS to the airlines, 
      emv enabling several airlines for the first time, and delivering the worlds first EMV mobile POS a decade ago.  
      </p>
      <p>We delivered the world‘s first PCI-P2PE payment applicaiton for mobile EMV and 
        built a state of the art platform for making mobile POS scalable, sustainable, and secure.  
      </p>
      <p>We opened access to that platform with the first simple APIs for iOS and Android, 
        bringing secure EMV to the dynamic space of nextgen pos.  We then certified the Handpoint platform 
        on 2 then 3 continents. 
      </p>
      <p>In 2017 we focused on the cloud, migrating and certifying our platform on AWS and delivering EMV 
        and NFC for web-based points of sale.  
      </p>
      <p> And now as the opportunity for omnicommerce continues to grow, we have expanded from to serve 
        that opportunity with tokenization with multiple acquirers, standalone integrated-ready terminals, 
        and new payment types for omnicommerce, while continuing our global expansion.

        Handpoint has been a pioneer in defining integrated payments, 
        from advancing the checkout experience with mobile technology 
        to launching open payment integrations for all emerging POS platforms -- on 3 continents.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide solutions for merchants, acquirers, payfacs, ISOs and ISVs who are delivering 
        this edge for payments: where customer experience and management matter, 
        where payments are embedded seamlessly, and where mobile technology fuels growth. 
        Handpoint's software terminal, international gateway, and terminal management system
        enable the future of acquiring, from mPOS and integrated POS to a future without terminals.

  - header: Getting set up
    txt: >
      <p>To accept payments, you need 2 more things: 1) an account set up with your payments provider, and 2) a Handpoint credit card terminal.</p><p class="specialtxt">Not sure if you have one? Get in touch with your provider.</p>
  - header: First Time Login
    txt: >
      <p>When you open the mPOS app for the first time, you’ll be asked to sign up by entering your email address. Then, you’ll be asked to create a unique, safe password.  Note: You must use the same e-mail address that you provided for setting up your Merchant Account with your provider.  That’s one way we know it’s you.</p> <p class="specialtxt">If you wish to use an alternative e-mail address, contact your provider to update your account.</p>
  - header: Connect your Card Reader
    txt: >
      <p>Once you are signed in, the mPOS app will prompt you to pair your card reader.</p>
      <p>Ensure your phone or tablet has Bluetooth turned on and that your card reader is switched on (hold down the power button).</p>
      <p>Then, in the Handpoint mPOS app, select the correct card reader from the list provided – it should match the serial number on the back of your card reader.</p>
      <p class="specialtxt">Don’t see the right serial number in the list?  Try this: Go in ‘Settings’ on the mPOS App, then select ‘Device.’ You should find your card reader’s serial number as an option there.</p><p>Once you see the Bluetooth icon on the HiLite card reader screen, you’ll know the card  reader is connected. This may take a few seconds.</p>
  - header: Card Reader Activation
    txt: >
      <p>Your card reader needs to download a few things before it can start taking your first payments.  But this is easy, and it won’t need to do this every time.</p>
      <p>Just click the ”PAY” button in the mPOS app.  You’ll be asked to choose the type of payment (Card/Cash/Other) – Choose ”Card.”  Then the update will start.</p>
      <p>You’ll see the words “UPDATING READER” appear.  The card reader is now automatically downloading any updates and setting itself up.  It will take a couple of minutes.</p> 
      <p>When it is done, the message “UPDATE COMPLETE” will appear and your card reader will automatically restart.</p>
      <p class="specialtxt">If that didn’t work, go into “Settings” on the mPOS App.  Tap on “Device.”  Then choose “Update Device.”</p>
  - header: Start taking payments
    txt: >
      <p>Once your card reader has restarted, you can start accepting payments with your mPOS solution. </p> 
      <p>Enter an amount, and click PAY.</p>

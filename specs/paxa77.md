				<h1>Handpoint PAX A77</h1>
				<p>With Handpoint’s powerful platform plus PAX’s A77, the power of mobile is exponential. The A77's sleek form factor makes it ultra-portable, so you can connect with customers anywhere. </p>  
				<p>Handpoint powers the PAX A77 in 3 ways:</p>
				<p>1) Merchants can use the PAX A77 as a highly mobile terminal with the <b><a href="https://handpoint.imgix.net/Website%20refresh%20photos/spec-sheets/Handpoint%20SmartPOS%20Quick%20Start%20Guide%20v.0621.pdf">Handpoint SmartPOS</a></b> app installed directly on the reader.</p>
				<p>2) Developers can put their own Android application onto the PAX A77 and utilize Handpoint’s fast and easy SDK to manage the entire payment experience within their own app.</p>
				<p>3) Developers can quickly integrate the PAX A77 with their POS  - whether online or native iOS, Android, Mac, or Windows -  for an elegant countertop or semi-unattended solution.  Handpoint’s innovative APIs offer the “perfect” semi-integration, with all payment handling and flow outside the POS.</p>
